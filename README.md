The application includes a client-server architecture with multiple clients, helping users find a recipe based on the chosen ingredients. The client and server are connected through sockets, and the server is multi-threaded. To log information to the server console and files, Singleton or Multiton design patterns are applied. The database connectivity enables the data to be stored. The technologies that are used in the project's development are Java, JavaFX for UI, and PostgreSQL. The system implements other multiple design patterns, including State and Observable patterns, but also MVVM as a software design pattern. The application is a group project, built using the SCRUM management framework and Unified Process Methodology.
